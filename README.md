#AIM : We all have access to the data, but I aim to turn that data into something impactful. Which I have aimed to do by finding the best features in data that can predict win accurately.
#Idea : One question people always ask to win a team is “Tell us about the winning recipe?”. Is there a secret ingredient? .It’s all started with one simple question. How small decisions players make during a game will have an impact on a game. For example, this idea we will analyze the armory. How small decision like buying a weapon in a particular round has an impact on match or not.
